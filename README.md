# SpoilerWall Extension

Browser extension version of [SpoilerWall](https://github.com/SebaRodriguezzz/spoilerwall).

Same idea, different approach — this one runs entirely in your browser and blocks spoilers directly on any page you visit. No server, no account needed, 100% local.

The [web app](https://spoilerwall.onrender.com/) lets you ask questions and get AI-powered answers about shows/movies up to where you've watched. This extension passively scans and hides spoiler content across social media, forums, and any other site as you browse.
